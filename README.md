# GROUP_1_OOP_ASSIGNMENT_2
# 1. Introduction
The Drone-Based Mobile Network Simulator is a Java-based software product designed to simulate a temporary mobile communication network deployed using drones. The project demonstrates how object-oriented programming principles can be applied to telecommunications engineering problems while providing a working interactive prototype.
# 2. System Overview
The system consists of user devices, drone base stations, and a simulation controller implemented through a console-based user interface. The interface enables users to register devices, initiate connections, and simulate data transmission in a controlled environment.

# 3. Languages used 
Java.

# 4. Programming concepts demonstrated
This project demonstrates some OOP concepts such as abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritance.  The code has been commented to point out particularly trickier concepts while the other clearer concepts can be observed while going through the code in the .java file in the same repository.
